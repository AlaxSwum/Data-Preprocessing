# Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline, transforming raw data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling. This process typically involves the following six steps:

## 1. Importing Data
- Load data from various sources such as CSV files, databases, or APIs.

## 2. Cleaning Data
- Ensure the data is accurate and ready for analysis. This involves several sub-steps detailed below.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyze the main characteristics of the data, often with visual methods.

## 4. Feature Engineering
- Create new features from the existing data to improve model performance.

## 5. Scaling and Normalization
- Standardize the range of independent variables or features of data.

## 6. Splitting into Training and Testing
- Divide the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model.

# Steps in Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is an essential part of data preprocessing that involves the following steps:

### 1. Handling Missing Values
- Identify and handle missing data points using methods such as imputation or deletion.

### 2. Removing Duplicate Values
- Eliminate redundant data entries to ensure each record is unique.

### 3. Handling Outliers
- Detect and manage outliers that can skew the data analysis and modeling.

### 4. Standardization Formats
- Ensure consistency in data formats, such as date formats, capitalization, and units of measurement.

### 5. Handling Incorrect Data
- Correct or remove erroneous data entries.

### 6. Encoding Categorical Variables
- Convert categorical data into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

### 7. Feature Scaling
- Apply scaling techniques like standardization or normalization to ensure features are on a similar scale.

### 8. Handling Imbalanced Data
- Address class imbalances in the data using methods like resampling or using different evaluation metrics.
